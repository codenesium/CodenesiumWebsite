When you generate a project and have the playground server enabled we build your project and deploy it to a server.

Every time you deploy a new database is created.

You can create a single migration in the client that is ran. This is useful to seed your test data.

The database for your application is limited to 50 MB on disk and is CPU throttled.

This deployed app is really just for testing that we can generate your application and should not be used for anything other than that.
